# DeltaBans
Banning plugin for BungeeCord/Velocity and Spigot servers that relies on SQL storage, [DbShare](https://github.com/geeitszee/DbShare)
for connection pooling, and [SockExchange](https://github.com/geeitszee/SockExchange)

## Installation
Copy the same JAR into the plugins directory of your BungeeCord/Velocity and Spigot installations. The
default configurations should be fine except for the `DbShareDataSourceName`. Change that setting
to match the name of the DbShare data source to load from and save to. In case of authentication
plugins, configure the `IpLookup` section of the Spigot configuration. This will add IPs to bans
if they are found otherwise all player bans will be based on just the name.
